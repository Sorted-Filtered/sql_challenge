Module 9

Project Description

Business's HR data was organized into a database with 6 tables (employees, departments, titles, salaries, department managers, and department employees) and analyzed based on certain needs (for example, query for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and a last name starting with the letter "B"). An ERD diagram is included for ease of use.

Execution

Run the schema file first to create the tables. The tables need data, so included in the Resources folder are "departments.csv", "employees.csv", "salaries.csv", "titles.csv", "dept_emp.csv", and "dept_manager.csv", one for each table with similar names. Data from the .csv files MUST BE IMPORTED IN THE ORDER THE TABLE WAS CREATED IN THE SCHEMA FILE! Import the data to each table individually and in order, and the SQLQueries file will work properly. 

Features

Folder includes schema file for loading tables, data for said tables in the Resources folder, and a SQLQueries file for the analysis. 

Contributors

EdX class code examples were loosely used for the entire project.
